      <h3>Information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>This was created during <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com">Ludum Dare 21</a>, where you program a game from scratch, within 48 hours. I started late. The theme for Ludum Date #21 was “Escape.”</li>
        <li><em>65-73-63</em> is “esc” in hex. : )</li>
        <li>I planned to put in launchers, boosters, and doors. I just did not have the time. I’ll probably do that later on.</li>
        <li>The level is really short. I was going to try randomly generate the level, but I didn’t get around to that either. Maybe in an update.</li>
        <li>My goal for Ludum Dare 21 was to get some familiarity with <a href="coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, as I’ll be using it when Rails 3.1 is released. I feel I did that, and I love it.</li>
        <li>I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/austinbirch">@austinbirch</a> on Twitter, and my blog is <a href="http://austinbirch.co.uk">here.</a></li>
